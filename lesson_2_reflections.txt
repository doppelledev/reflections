-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
		A .git folder is created. We need to do this to have a Git version-control over the files in the
	folder.

-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
		Before committing, we add fiels we want to commit to the staging area. Somtiems we don't want
	to commit certain files because we didn't finish working on them yet, that's where the staging area
	is useful.
